# First-task-by-ColaCrypto-of-UniCrypto
this is the work for Concordium Hackathon
Basically, I downloaded rust and cargo on my pc (in fact cargo concordium --help give me the right output)
then I installed concordium client, checked the installation and connected to the testnet mode
then come my favorite part: the creation of the concordium wallet, a well projected web wallet 
I created one and then import 2000 CCD through the testnet faucet
after all, I exported the keys of wallet in a .export file
at the end i import the key into my concordium-client configuration successfully!

my mainnet address is:

thanks to concordium team for the well-written docs!
